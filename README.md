# HotTopics - social media web-app
I built this app by myself as my Final Project for Harvard's CS50. HotTopic's is a social media app that lets users create posts with up to 4 choices and then like, comment and vote on other posts. You can stay connected by following other users to track the posts they make. My idea for this app was to create a site for people to share their thoughts and have others vote and comment, in other words, a place for people to guage opinions and debate.

## Video Demo
I've created a video going over the main functions of the app [here](LINK).

# Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.10.2
- Flask - version 2.0.1
- jQuery - version 3.6.0
- Flask-SQLAlchemy - version 2.5.1
- PostreSQL Database
- Deployed App to Heroku
- HTML/CSS

# Features/What I Learned
- Got comfortable with Flask microframework which included managing User-Authentication, creating forms and processing GET/POST requests.
- Used jQuery to dynamically load data from back-end using AJAX and JSON. Also made traversing DOM and selecting elements easy.
- SQLalchemy allowed me to create models to represent data for users and posts. This made querying my PostgreSQL database simpler by using the relational models.
- App's styles are designed for both mobile and desktop devices using media-queries.

# Status - Complete
My app is finished and is deployed to Heroku. Visit the site using this [link](https://hottopics1.herokuapp.com/).

# Acknowledgements
I created my Flask back-end by following Corey Schafer's ["Python Flask Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH)
